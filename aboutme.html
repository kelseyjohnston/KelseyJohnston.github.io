    <body>

    	<P> My name is Kelsey Johnston and I was born and raised in York Maine. I graduated from York Highschool in 2018 where my only sibling will be graduating from this year. My grandfather went to the The University of Maine, my parents met here, now I go here, and my brother will be going here next year. Last year I was an Art Major, but switched to Marketing this year while also working to get a graphic design minor.  I love taking photos, doing art, going to the beach, hiking,hanging out with friends, watching sports, and I love traveling. In the past few years I have gone on big and small trips including Ecuador, The Galapogos Islands, Puerto Rico, Florida, and 4 trips to Canada. Here are a few pictures of what I've been up to this school year. </P>
